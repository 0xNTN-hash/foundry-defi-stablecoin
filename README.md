## DeFi Stablecoin

1. **Relative stability:** Anchored or Pegged -> $1.00
    - Chainlink Price feed.
    - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
2. **Stability Mechanism (Minting):** Algoritmic (Decentralize)
    - People can only mint the stablecoin with enougt collateral (coded)
3. **Collatera:** Exogenous (Crypto)
    - wETH & wBTC

## Bugs found during testing

1. O devision if no DSC minted
2. Crash if the user tries to redeem more collateral than the deposited collateral
